## Current State: 2.0

In Version 2.0, CallFilterPro now supports **direct voicemail transcription import** without requiring the user to manually speak the message into the app. Once imported, the app automatically transcribes the voicemail, runs a Core ML–powered text classification model, and labels it as **spam** or **legitimate** instantly.

**Key Improvements in 2.0:**
- Direct integration with voicemail transcription for a seamless experience.
- Core ML–based spam detection model for faster, more accurate classification.
- Enhanced UI for message review and classification results.
- Optimized on-device processing to ensure **privacy** and **offline functionality**.
